1. Introduction
                                                                   
  uNESsential is a NES emulator written in QBasic.
  It is written by Johannes Holmberg and Bjîrn "_Bnu" èstrîm.

2. What's new                
                               
  Version 0.14
  - _Bnu of AR/ZD/Emucamp/N'tendo fame has joined the project.
  - File requester implemented.
  - Gui is more informative.
  - Debugger somewhat wrecked. (No opcode displaying)
  - Amount of stupidity in CPU core reduced. Faster and smaller.
  - Opcodes LSR and STA(?) fixed unintentionally.
  - Opcodes ROL and ROR fixed. Stupid error.
  - Opcodes ADC and SBC fixed.
  - Better timing.
  - Something wrecked in the process of reducing stupidity. (Dunno what)

3. Instructions                                                    
                                                                     
  How to use it:                                                     
  There are two ways to run uNESsential.
  Either by typing
  "uness rom.nes"
  or by simply typing
  "uness"
  which will bring up the file requester.

  Joypad Keys:                                                       
  Arrows - Directional pad                                           
  Z      - A                                                         
  X      - B                                                         
  C      - Select                                                    
  V      - Start                                                     
                                                                     
  Other Keys:                                                        
                                                                     
  Q      - Quit                                                      
  O      - Toggle opcode output                                      
  P      - Toggle opcode output                                      
  B      - Breakpoint

  Opcode output is broken as of version 0.14. You can still use the
  O key to look at the registers though.
  This will probably be fixed in the next version.
  Joypad emulation works on a toggle basis. Don't keep the physical
  keys pressed, or you will go deaf.
  To set a breakpoint, press B and then use the keys 1,2,3 and 4 to
  choose a breakpoint and hit enter.


  4. Requirements                                            
                                                             
  I'm not sure about system requirements really, but here's  
  what I think should be sufficient:                         
                                                             
  A PC capable of VGA graphics.                              
  About 100kb of hard drive space for swap files.            
  A few kilobytes of conventional memory.                    
                                                             
  A Pentium II is highly recommended.
                                                             
  To play games at full speed (60 fps) you will need a       
  processor of at least 100Ghz.                              


5. Emulation                                                  
                                                                
  What it emulates:                                             
  - All of the 6502 opcodes (I think).
  - Most of the PPU
  - Joypad 1
                                                                
  What it will emulate in the future:                           
  - Attribute tables
  - Scrolling
  - Joypad 2 (Possibly 3 and 4 too)                             
  - Palettes                                                    
  - Sound (only if we manage to speed up emulation remarkably).  
  - Some more mappers.                                          



6. Misc.                                                     
                                                               
  Other things you should know:                                
  
  If a game seems to get stuck on the title screen.
  Give it some time, go eat lunch or something.
  Some games need more than 100 frames to actually
  get into the game.

  I destroyed the opcode outputing because it was coded in a stupid way which
  slowed down emulation. It will be back in the next version.

  Sprite flipping does not currently work in the y-axis.
  I don't know of any game which uses it which means that any implementation
  of it will be terribly buggy.

  We will probably implement palette emulation soon, but
  the colours will never be correct since we're using a 16 colour
  video mode.

  Compatibility list:
  As of v0.14 a few games actually work.
  I don't feel like making a list though.
  Some games that work are.
  Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong Junior and Ice Climber.
  Ice Climber is unplayable due to the lack of scrolling :)
  
  Why uNESs? The extra 's' is because I don't want people to   
  confuse uNESsential with another emulator called             
  Ultimate NES (uNES).                                         

7. Credits

  - AkIlLa^ for pointing out errors and making suggestions,
            and implementing the zaniest features in Nes4pc
            just to allow me to debug my cpu core.
  - Whoever wrote the cart.nes rom.
  - Probably some more people. Mail us if we forgot you.       



8. Disclaimer
